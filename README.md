## Regex Components

### Anchors

### Quantifiers

### OR Operator

### Character Classes

A regex includes simple characters and special characters. Simple characters are characters that mean exactly what they are. An example would be the alphabet such as "a" means "a". [abcd] is the same [a-d] which specifies a range of characters.

Character classes are specific subsets of characters. Regex will try to match a single character of an input string to a character from a set.

* [] means to match any of the included characters
* [^]
* . means to match every character
* All characters and special characters located in the [] means they are to be taken for their literal value
